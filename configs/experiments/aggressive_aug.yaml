# Aggressive Augmentation Experiment Variant
# ==========================================
# This configuration enables aggressive data augmentation for
# training on challenging datasets or improving generalization.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m ibis_net.train_cli fit --config configs/base.yaml --config configs/experiments/aggressive_aug.yaml
#
# Note: Aggressive augmentation may require smaller batch sizes
# due to increased memory usage from augmentation transforms.

data:
  # Use aggressive augmentation preset (includes horizontal flip)
  aug_preset_train: aggressive

  # Smaller batch size for memory efficiency with augmentations
  batch_size_train: 4
